.B Attention:
The proberoute command is only intended for use in network
testing, measurement, and management\&. It should be used primarily
for manual fault isolation\&. Because of the load it imposes on the
network and causes some security implications, the proberoute command
requires super-user privileges, and should not be used during normal
operations or from automated scripts\&.

.PP
Proberoute is a program that behaves in much the same way that
\fBtraceroute(8)\fP does, but has more options\&. The proberoute
command attempts to trace the route an IP packet follows to a target
host by launching UDP/TCP/ICMP probe packets with a small maximum
time\-to\-live (Max_ttl variable), then listening for an ICMP
.B TIME_EXCEEDED
response from gateways along the way\&. Probes are
started with an Max_ttl value of one hop, which is increased one hop
at a time until an ICMP
.B PORT_UNREACHABLE,
.B ICMP_ECHOREPLY,
.B ICMP_TSTAMPREPLY
or
TCP
.B RST,
.B SYN,
.B ACK
messages is returned\&. These messages indicates that the host has been
located.
.PP
Unlike the traceroute program, the proberoute default sends three TCP
probes at each Max_ttl setting to record the following:
.br
.nf
*   Max_ttl value
.br
*   Address of the gateway
.br
*   Round-trip time of each successful probe
.fi
.PP
The number of probes sent can be increased by using the \fB\-q\fP
flag\&. If the probe answers come from different gateways, the command
prints the address of each responding system. If there is no
response from a probe within a 3-second time\-out interval, an
\fB*\fP (asterisk) is printed for that probe.
.PP
The proberoute command prints an \fB!\fP (exclamation mark) with an
abbreviation before the round-trip time indicates that received the ICMP
notification message:

.PP 
Increase the verbosity by \fB-v\fP flag will show the detail
message\&. When received the ICMP Need Fragment error message (!F
flag), the proberoute program will change the next hop MTU with the
same Max_ttl value and trying again\&. If the ICMP error message is not
expected, the proberoute command will exit\&.

The TCP/UDP probe packets are set to an unlikely value so as to
prevent processing by the destination host\&. You can change the
destination port with \fB-p\fP option\&.

.B Item
Destination
.TP \w'names'u+4
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Verbose output, multiple -v options increase the verbosity.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show the brief help message.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.BI \-P " protocol"
Send packets of specified IP protocol.
.I
protocol
should be \&"TCP\&", \&"UDP\&" or \&"ICMP\&". Alternately, you can specify the
.B
\-\-tcp, \-\-udp,
or
.B
\-\-icmp
flags\&.
.B
Note:
these options can be specified at the same time\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.B \-A, \-\-all
Same as '--tcp --udp --icmp'\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.BI \-p,\ \-\-port " portnum"
Set the base destination port number for TCP or UDP, the default is
33434\&. The proberoute command will increment the UDP port number
every Max_ttl, but keep the TCP port number unchanged\&.
.B
Note: when UDP and TCP probe packets are used at the same time, this
option is valid only for TCP probes, while UDP base port number is
fixed to 33434\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.BI \-g,\ \-\-source\-port " portnum"
For UDP, TCP, set the source port number used in probes\&. The default
is random port\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.BI \-S,\ \-\-source\-ip " IPaddr"
Set the source address for probes, must use \fB-i\fP option to specify
the interface you wish to send\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.BI \-i " interface"
Specify a network interface to send probes and obtain the source IP
address for outgoing probe packets\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.BI \-q " nqueries"
Specifies the number of probe packets the traceroute command sends at
each Max_ttl setting\&. The default is three probes\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.BI \-w " waittime"
Sets the time (in seconds) to wait for a response to a probe\&. The
default is 3 seconds\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.BI \-f " first_ttl"
Set the initial time\-to\-live used in outgoing probe packets\&. The
default is 1, i\&.e\&., start with the first hop\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.BI \-m " max_ttl"
Set the max time\-to\-live (max number of hops) used in outgoing probe packets.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.BI \-F,\ \-\-frag\-size " frag_size"
Specify the IP fragment size (must be a multiple of eight)\&. Because
some firewalls don't check the fragmented packets for performance
reasons, fragments are possible to reach the host\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.BI \-s,\ \-\-mtu " MTUsize"
Using the specified MTU as the probe packets size\&. Default is auto
detection\&.
.B
Note: when UDP and other protocols are used at the same time, this
option is only valid for other protocols while the UDP packet length is
fixed to 52-byte\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.B \-\-conn \fR(TCP connect probe)\fP
TCP connect probe is usable for detecting the path MTU when the
firewall only opening for the specific TCP port\&. When the connection
established, the proberoute program will send the out\-of\-sequence
probe packet with specific length and TCP flags (usually with
\fB\-\-ack\fP flag), for preventing processing by the destination
host\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.B \-\-syn\fR/\fPack\fR/\fPpush\fR/\fPnull\fR/\fPfin\fR/\fPxmas
Use TCP SYN, ACK, PUSH, Null, FIN and Xmas probes with \fB\-\-tcp\fP
option\&. This feature comes from the \fBnmap(1)\fP
program\&. \fB\-\-null\fP option doesn't set any bits (TCP flag header
is 0), \fB\-\-xmas\fP sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags. When the
firewall is open, references to the RFC 793 (Page 65)
.RS \w'names'u+4
.IP \(bu
If the target host state is CLOSED, an incoming segment not containing
a RST causes a RST to be sent in response\&.
.IP \(bu
If the target host state is LISTEN, any acknowledgment segment causes
a RST to be sent in response\&.
.IP \(bu
If the target host state is LISTEN, the SYN packet causes a SYN + ACK
to be sent in response\&.
.IP \(bu
If the target host state is ESTABLISHED, the out\-of\-sequence packet
causes an ACK should be sent in response\&.
.RE
.TP \w'names'u+4
.B \-\-badsum
Send the probe packets with a bogus checksum\&. Since virtually all
host IP stacks properly drop these packets, any responses received are
likely coming from a firewall or IDS that didn't bother to verify the
checksum\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.B \-\-badlen
Send the probe packets with a bad IP option length (by IP timestamp
option)\&. An ICMP Parameter Problem error message will be sent when a
router (MUST generate this message) or a host (SHOULD generate this
message) finds a problem with the IP header parameters\&. This option is
not very helpful for tracing route\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.B \-e, \-\-echo
.sp -0.8v
.TP \w'names'u+4
.B \-\-echo\-reply
Send ICMP echo/echo\-reply probes\&. when the firewall is open:
.RS \w'names'u+4
.IP \(bu
The \fBICMP_ECHO\fP probe causes the target host MUST response the
\fBICMP_ECHOREPLY\fP message\&.
.IP \(bu
The \fBICMP_ECHOREPLY\fP probe causes the target host MAY response the
\fBICMP_UNREACH_PORT\fP message\&.
.RE

.B \-\-tstamp\-reply
Send ICMP timestamp/timestamp\-reply probes\&. when the firewall is open:
.RS \w'names'u+4
.IP \(bu
The \fBICMP_TSTAMP\fP probe causes the target host MAY response the
\fBICMP_TSTAMPREPLY\fP message\&.
.IP \(bu
The \fBICMP_TSTAMPREPLY\fP probe causes the target host MAY response
the \fBICMP_UNREACH_PORT\fP message\&.
.RE
.TP \w'names'u+4
.BI \-j,\ \-\-source-route " gateway"
Sets IP Loose Source Route option\&. Tell the network to route the
packet through the specified gateway (Unfortunately, most routers have
disabled source routing for security reasons)\&.

.B HOST
Specifies the destination host, either by host name or IP number. This
parameter is required\&.
.TP \w'names'u+4
.B PORT
Specifies the destination port or service for TCP or UDP protocol\&. The
default port is 33434\&.
.PP
.SH "SECURITY"
This command requires privileged users due to using \fBlibpcap\fP and
raw socket\&.
.PP
.SH "SEE ALSO"
traceroute(8), nmap(1), ping(1)
.PP
.SH "WARNING"
Since the \fB\-\-frag\-size\fP can split the packet into eight bytes,
so a 20-byte TCP header would be split into three packets, but this
feature can not be supported on some systems\&.
.PP
.SH BUGS
Specify the fragment size of eight bytes MAY causes the AIX system
crash\&. In addition, the TCP packet can't be fragmented less than the
size of header on AIX\&. Any bug should be reported to Cun Gong
<gong_cun@bocmacau.com>\&.
